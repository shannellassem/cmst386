    <h1> Questions</h1>
        <h2>How do Search Engines Work</h2>
            <p>Search engines help user find things on the internet. They use special programs called bots to look through websites and collect information. This info gets stored in a big list, called an index. When you search for something, the engine looks through that list to find the best and most helpful pages for you.</p>
        <h2>The Importance of Keywords and Descriptions as Meta Tags</h2>
            <p>Keywords and meta descriptions help search engines understand what your website is about. Keywords are words people might type into a search. Meta descriptions are short summaries that show up under the page title in search results. When both are written well, they can help your site show up higher and get more clicks.</p>
        <h2>Four elements that comprise writing relevant content</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Relevance and Context: A good link should match the topic of the page. It should fit naturally in the sentence and help the reader learn more. Search engines also look at the words around the link to understand if it’s useful.</li>
                <li>Descriptive Anchor Text: The clickable words (anchor text) should clearly say where the link goes. Avoid using words like “click here.” Instead, use words that describe the page, like “easy dinner recipes” or “puppy training tips.”</li>
                <li>Value and Purpose: Every link should have a reason. It should help the reader by giving more info, proving a point, or leading to related topics. Good links fit into the writing and add value to the reader’s experience.</li>
                <li>Strategic Placement and Quantity: Put links inside your main content where they make sense. Don’t add too many links, because that can confuse readers. Only include links that are helpful and important to the topic.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Good heading hierarchy </h2>
            <p>A good heading hierarchy means using titles and subtitles in the right order. Start with one big title (H1), then use smaller ones (H2, H3, etc.) for different sections. This helps readers and search engines understand the structure of your page.</p>
