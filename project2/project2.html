        <section class="growth">
            <h2>Growth and Maintenance </h2>
            <p>As Bujo Dream grows, I’ll expand into digital downloads, journaling challenges, and guest blog posts. To make the site easy to maintain, I’ll use reusable page layouts and organize content by category. Monthly updates will include adding tutorials, updating inspiration galleries, and checking all pages for errors, broken links, or outdated info.</p>

        <section class="organization">
            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>The site will be organized into 10 main pages.</p>

        <section class="security">
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>It will be optional for users to creat an account or not. Creating an account allows users to save any guides, tutorials, or inspiration they find on the site. There will be an e-commerce that allows users to buy merch. So password protection is needed. However, I will ensure security by using HTTPS, keeping images optimized, and not including any unsafe third-party plugins or forms. If I embed content, I’ll only use secure, trusted platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest.
            </p>

        <section class="web_hosting">
            <h2>Web Hosting</h2>
            <p>To select a web host, I’ll compare options based on cost, uptime, speed, SSL availability, and ease of uploading static websites. Since Bujo Dream may include image galleries, and eccomerce, the host should support fast image delivery and responsive design. While I won’t use advanced backend features yet, I want a host that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I found that bujodream.com is available. This domain will help with SEO and branding. I used <a href=“https://www.networksolutions.com/”>Network Solutions</a> to check for domain availability. The most common host for sites like thes is Wix, SqaureSpace, and Shopify.</p>
